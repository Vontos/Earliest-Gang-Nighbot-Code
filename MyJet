a = ["I am a member of the flight simulation community, and my avatar is a jet fighter pilot. like most avatars in this community, mine is an avatar that looks exactly like me: it’s a pretty girl with long dark hair. she has no name; I don’t know what her name would be in real life, but I call her ‘my jet’ because that is how i feel about her. ", 
"I have been flying jets for over twenty years now, and she is one of the best pilots on twitch chat. Over the last couple months, we got to talking during some of my livestreams and she asked if i had ever flown in competition before. I told her that I had only tried once or twice back when I was younger, and never really won. I am not particularly competitive by nature, so I didn’t think much about it after that conversation.", 
"A few weeks later, however, she messaged me privately asking if I wanted to fly in a big tournament that was coming up soon. I said sure, thinking nothing of it. the next day, she sent me information on the event: the twitch chat online championship.",
"I was curious about this event since I hadn't heard of it before, but I figured it might just be another regular online tournament I could fly in every year, and thought little more about it."];
