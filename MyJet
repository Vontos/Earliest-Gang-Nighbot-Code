a = ["I am a member of the flight simulation community, and my avatar is a jet fighter pilot. Like most avatars in this community, mine is an avatar that looks exactly like me: it’s a pretty girl with long dark hair. She has no name; I don’t know what her name would be in real life, but I call her ‘my jet’ because that is how I feel about her. ", 
"I have been flying jets for over twenty years now, and she is one of the best pilots on Twitch Chat. Over the last couple months, we got to talking during some of my livestreams and she asked if I had ever flown in competition before.",
"I told her that I had only tried once or twice back when I was younger and never really won. I am not particularly competitive by nature, so I didn’t think much about it after that conversation.", 
"A few weeks later, however, she messaged me privately asking if I wanted to fly in a big tournament that was coming up soon. I said sure, thinking nothing of it. the next day, she sent me information on the event: the Twitch Chat Online Championship.",
"I was curious about this event since I hadn't heard of it before, but I figured it might just be another regular online tournament I could fly in every year and thought little more about it.",
"A week later, I received an email from someone named Mike, who said he was the organizer of the tournament. He explained that this was going to be a huge event, and asked if I was interested in participating. again, I decided to say yes without thinking too hard about it. The next morning, I logged into Twitch Chat and saw that the tournament had begun.",
"There were twelve teams, each made up of six pilots. We all flew together on one large server, and our team was called the Super-Fighters. There was another team called the Deathhawks. We did not get along well at first. We spent many hours flying together, learning tactics and getting used to one another's styles.",
"Ultimately, we came to respect each other as individuals. By the end of the tournament, we were truly friends, and we had all learned a lot from the experience.",
"I know this sounds crazy, but that was the moment when I realized what a special place my Twitch Chat community is: it feels more like a family than anything else. our families don't care where you live or how old you are or what your race is.",
"They don't judge us based on our political beliefs or the clothes we wear or even whether or not we're married. When we talk, we can speak freely, and we don't fear being ostracized for our opinions. It took me a long time to understand this, but now that I do, I appreciate it more than I can express in words.",
"The next step will be for 'my jet' to compete in the IVAO Flight Simulator Championship Tournament (IVAO FSC), which is held in real life at various locations around the world. There are usually five to eight qualifying rounds held throughout the year.",
"In addition to these qualifiers, there is also the IVAO World Air Games, which includes two days of online events. The winners of these games earn medals, which are given out in recognition of their skill level.",
"I'm looking forward to watching 'my jet' compete against the best pilots in the world. against all odds, she did win first place in the online championship tournament; but it didn't take place at a location outside of my home; it happened right here on Twitch Chat! If anyone can do it again at an IVAO FSC event outside of Twitch Chat, it's 'my jet'",
"But then, something happened that none of us expected. A man appeared on our Twitch Chat channel, claiming to be an employee of the IVAO Flight Simulation Organization."];
